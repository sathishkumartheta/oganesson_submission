Here's a summary of the recent news from Bengaluru:

Bengaluru is expecting patchy rain and mild temperatures around 20.8Â°C with an 89% chance of precipitation on July 23, 2025. Residents should prepare for continued overcast skies and occasional rain throughout the week.

In concerning news, two women in Bengaluru were victims of a digital arrest scam. Fraudsters, posing as police officers, coerced them into stripping during a fake online examination and tricked them into transferring Rs 58,447. The fraudsters threatened to release nude photos.

On a positive note, tenders have been floated for the construction of two world-class sports complexes in Bengaluru.

The High Court has ordered notice to the Karnataka government regarding the validity of 'Greater Bengaluru'.

A merchant in Bengaluru lost Rs 4.5 lakh to currency exchange fraudsters in a 'Riyal-life trap'.

The 'Panchapeeta' backing for Vijayendra could complicate the power tussle within the BJP.
